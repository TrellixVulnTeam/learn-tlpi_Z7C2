# The note when I'm Learning TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface)

This is the note and the source code of my solution for TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface)

Cause I'm reading the Chinese version of the book, the note is mainly be written in Chinese.

Still work in progress.

The original example source code and header file could be downloaded at [auther's website](https://man7.org/tlpi/code/index.html)
