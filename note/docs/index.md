# The note when I'm Learning TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface)

This is the note and the source code of my solution for TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface)

Cause I'm reading the Chinese version of the book, the note is mainly be written in Chinese.

Still work in progress.

The original example source code and header file could be downloaded at [auther's website](https://man7.org/tlpi/code/index.html)

You could clone the whole repository and compile the code yourself.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/panxiao81/learn-tlpi
$ sudo apt install build-essential libcap-dev libacl1-dev libselinux1-dev libseccomp-dev gcc-multilib
$ cd learn-tlpi && make
```

The source code I've written is under `src/` folder.
