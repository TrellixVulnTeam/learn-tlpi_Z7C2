# Learn TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface)

This is the source code and the note of my solution for TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface)

Still work in progress.

Since the book which I have read is mainly focused on the Chinese version, My note is mainly written in Chinese.

The original example source code and header file could be downloaded at [auther's website](https://man7.org/tlpi/code/index.html)
